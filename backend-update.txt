  - /categories (GET)
    - don't need to include products which are belonged to the category. but need total count of products.
    
  - /users/{userId}/carts => /users/{userId}/cartItems 
    
    - add below endpoints
      - (PUT): replace existing one with new one
        - to update quantity/is_selected and other stuff.
        - return only updated one.
        
  - /users/{userId}/wishlist => /users/{userId}/wishlistItems
      
    - don't need to implement PUT/PATCH because of its context
    
  - /users
  
    - implement that only update property which has value (not null)
    
    - (/users/{userId}/phones) implement user phone managment endpoint (like addresses)
    
      - do i need customers have multiple phone numbers??
      
      - implement 'isSelected' (PATCH) endpoint (wihtout any request body) to switch the primary phone numbers (need to make the previous primary phone flase if there is a new primary)

## Stripe

  ### Refunds workflows
  
    1) you can program this for automation, or 
    
      - desc: provide UI to the customer so that they can click a button to refunds and process the request when we received.
      
      - concerns: 
        - maybe we need to create refounds policy otherwise, the customer can refunds any time and that would have loss of our business.
    
    2) handle manutally.
    
      - desc: create contact form and ask them to send us refunds request.
      
      - concerns:
        in either way, i need to create refunds policy and contact form.
        
  ### Notification 
  
    - after payment transaction complemeted regardless of success/failure, we need to let the customer know via email.
    
    - use 'webhooks' provided by Stripe. (ref: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/fulfill-orders)
    
  ### Shipping Cost and Available Countries
  
    - need to decide how to handle it
    
  ### Tax
  
    - there is threshold for GST stuff for government => $30,000
    - there is threshold for PST stuff for province (BC) => $10,000
    
      - so don't need to think about it yet.
