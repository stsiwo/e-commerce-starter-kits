endpoint change:

  - /categories (GET)
    - don't need to include products which are belonged to the category.
    
  - /users/{userId}/carts => /users/{userId}/cartItems 
    - to avoid confusion.
      - a user has only one cart and this endpoint is to manage cart items (not cart itself)

    - add below endpoints
      - (PUT): replace existing one with new one
        - to update quantity/is_selected and other stuff.
        - return only updated one.
        
  - /users/{userId}/wishlist => /users/{userId}/wishlistItems
    - to avoid confusion.
      - a user has only one cart and this endpoint is to manage cart items (not cart itself)
      
    - don't need to implement PUT/PATCH because of its context
