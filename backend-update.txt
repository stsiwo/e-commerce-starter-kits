endpoint change:
  
  
  - domain calculated values:
    - e.g., cheapest price of the product, avg review points and so on
    
    - create a property of DTO for each domain calculated values so that you don't need to calculate this at front-end again.

    - properties:
    
      - (order) totalCost: prevent front-end from calculating (single source of truth)
      
      - (order) mainImagePath: from the first order detail's product main image (for order list page of member)
        
      - (product) discountEndDate if it is discount to display at front end.

  - /products (GET) 
  
    - isDiscount query does not work correctly. it return empty result even if some variants have discounts.
    
    - min/maxPrice: something is wrong. when 0 (min) - 50 (max), return nothing.
    
  - performance:
  
    - identify N+1 sql using logging & monitor.
    
  - security: 
  
    - trim all string input from client. (need to test)
    
    - cross site request forgery enable. research on this subject since we use cookie (httpOnly&secure).
    
    - disable cart icon (on header) when checkout page (don't need to cart drawer at this page)
    
  - unit test
    - addable next order event status
    
  - refund/cancel/return integration with payment system.
    - make sure it works.
    
  - notification 
    - complete notification (e.g., adding notification type and publish the event to create a new notification, scheduling tasks to delete read notification)
    
  - hibernate association testing
    - make sure if product is deleted, its associated orders are not deleted and so on.
    
  - category
    - cateogry name must be unique => implement at app service.

  
    
      
    

## Stripe

  ### Refunds workflows
  
    1) you can program this for automation, or 
    
      - desc: provide UI to the customer so that they can click a button to refunds and process the request when we received.
      
      - concerns: 
        - maybe we need to create refounds policy otherwise, the customer can refunds any time and that would have loss of our business.
    
    2) handle manutally.
    
      - desc: create contact form and ask them to send us refunds request.
      
      - concerns:
        in either way, i need to create refunds policy and contact form.
        
  ### Notification 
  
    - after payment transaction complemeted regardless of success/failure, we need to let the customer know via email.
    
    - use 'webhooks' provided by Stripe. (ref: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/fulfill-orders)
    
  ### Shipping Cost and Available Countries
  
    - need to decide how to handle it
    
  ### Tax
  
    - there is threshold for GST stuff for government => $30,000
    - there is threshold for PST stuff for province (BC) => $10,000
    
      - so don't need to think about it yet.
