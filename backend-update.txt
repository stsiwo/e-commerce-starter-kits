endpoint change:
  
  
  - domain calculated values:
    - e.g., cheapest price of the product, avg review points and so on
    
    - create a property of DTO for each domain calculated values so that you don't need to calculate this at front-end again.

    - properties:
    
      - (order) totalCost: prevent front-end from calculating (single source of truth)
      
      - (order) mainImagePath: from the first order detail's product main image (for order list page of member)
      
      - isReviewable: not working correctly. it's always returning true.
        
  - /products (GET) 
  
    - isDiscount query does not work correctly. it return empty result even if some variants have discounts.
    
    - min/maxPrice: something is wrong. when 0 (min) - 50 (max), return nothing.
    
  - performance:
  
    - identify N+1 sql using logging & monitor.

      - almost done, but when try to join fetch a deep nested entity such as order.orderDetail.product or variants
        => this will complains about "MultipleBagsException".
    
  - security: 
  
    - trim all string input from client. (need to test)
    
    - cross site request forgery enable. research on this subject since we use cookie (httpOnly&secure).
    
  - refund/cancel/return integration with payment system.
    - make sure it works.

  - hibernate association testing
    - make sure if product is deleted, its associated orders are not deleted and so on.
    
  - async testing 
    - make sure how to handle async event handler at test

  - complete email implementation.
    - need to release the limit of aws ses to use 'no-reply'@domain
   
  - email verification propt  if user still temp user.
  
  - file directory backup
    - better to use S3 so that you don't need to think about backup stuff.
    
  - need to return current price based on discount availability and product & product variant price to client.
  

  
  
## staging bugs

(generals)

  
(companies)
  - update does not work at admin.
  
(email)
  - sign up does not send verification email. maybe misconfig of email.
  
  
    
      
    

## Stripe

  ### Refunds workflows
  
    1) you can program this for automation, or 
    
      - desc: provide UI to the customer so that they can click a button to refunds and process the request when we received.
      
      - concerns: 
        - maybe we need to create refounds policy otherwise, the customer can refunds any time and that would have loss of our business.
    
    2) handle manutally.
    
      - desc: create contact form and ask them to send us refunds request.
      
      - concerns:
        in either way, i need to create refunds policy and contact form.
        
  ### Notification 
  
    - after payment transaction complemeted regardless of success/failure, we need to let the customer know via email.
    
    - use 'webhooks' provided by Stripe. (ref: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/fulfill-orders)
    
  ### Shipping Cost and Available Countries
  
    - need to decide how to handle it
    
  ### Tax
  
    - there is threshold for GST stuff for government => $30,000
    - there is threshold for PST stuff for province (BC) => $10,000
    
      - so don't need to think about it yet.
