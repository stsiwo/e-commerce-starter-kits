## Stripe

  ### Refunds workflows
  
    1) you can program this for automation, or 
    
      - desc: provide UI to the customer so that they can click a button to refunds and process the request when we received.
      
      - concerns: 
        - maybe we need to create refounds policy otherwise, the customer can refunds any time and that would have loss of our business.
    
    2) handle manutally.
    
      - desc: create contact form and ask them to send us refunds request.
      
      - concerns:
        in either way, i need to create refunds policy and contact form.
        
  ### Notification 
  
    - after payment transaction complemeted regardless of success/failure, we need to let the customer know via email.
    
    - use 'webhooks' provided by Stripe. (ref: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/fulfill-orders)
    
  ### Shipping Cost and Available Countries
  
    - need to decide how to handle it

    - there is threshold for PST stuff for province (BC) => $10,000
