- (IMPL) add contact page
  
  - recapcha for security
  
- (IMPL) popup for signup 

  - esp when the guest user purchases.
  
    - if the guest user decide to signup, we need to save cart items to the backend.
    
    - flow
    
      1. the guest user signup
      2. if succeeded, also send POST request to cartItem endpoint to create the guest user's cart info.
      3. get the user back to the checkout page.
