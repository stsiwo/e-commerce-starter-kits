- (IMPL) add contact page
  
  - recapcha for security
  
- (IMPL) popup for signup 

  - esp when the guest user purchases.
  
    - if the guest user decide to signup, we need to save cart items to the backend.
    
    - flow
    
      1. the guest user signup
      2. if succeeded, also send POST request to cartItem endpoint to create the guest user's cart info.
      3. get the user back to the checkout page.
  
- (testing) admin endpoints request testing (products, orders, categories, customers, and so on)
 
 - (implementation) add logo image upload at admin 
 
 - (refactor) refactor snackbar and spinner : need to make sure the logic

 - guest user data transition when he becomes member:
   - carts
 
    - when you merge cart items of guest user to the cart items of the member user when the guest user signs up, make sure that don't send 'cartItemId' to the backend. 
  
    - cart items of guest users have temp cart item id for each temporarly.
    
    solution: add user and cartItems to AuthenticationCriteria (e.g., email & password) then publish the event to persist the user and the cartItems.
    
  - should I set max cart item numbers? like 5.
  
    - should i restrict teh selection of cartItems or price??

  
 - (performance)
  - tree shaking is not working (material ui). maybe.

    
- email verification prompt if the user still temp

- enable review only after the item is delivered. => create @Format isReadyReview to check the order events inlcude delivered.

- disable cart icon (on header) when checkout page (don't need to cart drawer at this page)

- product discunt end date
          => should be done front end. 
            => search page, you just need to display 'isDiscountAvailable' from product entity
            => on detail page, you just check where the discount is originated from (e.g., from product or product variant) and display the date on the detail page when user switch the variant.
